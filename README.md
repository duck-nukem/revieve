* Most of the tasks could be completed using basic SQL queries. I'm unsure what's the expectation regarding this exercise (more programming oriented, therefore a more complete solution is welcome; or more system design oriented, where the right call would be to set up a script to use the CSV files as the source of truth, transform them to database rows, and utilise SQL to perform the queries).
